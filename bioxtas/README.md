# BioXTAS Notes

I'm going back and forth with installing BioXTAS into the Docker container from a source zip file and/or directly from GitHub `main`.

Currently, this file does not work

`https://github.com/jbhopkins/bioxtasraw/archive/refs/tags/v2.2.2.zip`

I'm not sure if it is the same as:

`https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw/files/RAW-2.2.2-source.zip/download`

Installing from GitHub main ef5a982a862a770f92861a30b3696af0f50e5e95 does seem to work.
